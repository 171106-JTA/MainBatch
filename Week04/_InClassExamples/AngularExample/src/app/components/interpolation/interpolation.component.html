<h3>String Interpolation</h3>
<p>Angular uses a concept called data binding.
    This boils down to how we can connect our front end (view)
    to our backend (components).
    Any data in our components needs to have a way to be transferred
    to the view (html file).

    One way to do this, is to use String interpolation.

<div>
    The value of componentVariable is: {{componentVariable}}
</div>
