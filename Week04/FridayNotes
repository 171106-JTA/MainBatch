Angular: Subscribe, Observable
JavaScript: Promises

Promise vs Observable: 
Angular uses Observable ojects when making asynchronous calls
A Promise is a type of object where when a user sends data, we 
are gaurnateed to get something back. In the case o sending a request
we either get back an object representing the data received, or an object 
represeitng the rror we received
Promises can only listen on one eent at a time, on top of which, a user
cannot cancer the event one started. If I cannot halt a request to a server, I must wiat for some 
king of reponse to come back

Observalbe are the same as promises except with more featuers. Observables send the data back, essentially, as a stream. 
With that, Observalbe cn provide support for 0 to many events at a time, Observale also supports canceling the event.
