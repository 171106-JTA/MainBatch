<h3>STRING INTERPOLATION</h3>
<div class="well">
    <p>
        Angular uses a concept called data binding.
        This boils down to how we can connect our front end (view) to our backend (components).
        Any data in our components needs to have a way to be transferred to the View (html file).

        One way to do this is to use String Interpolation.
