	- At least a username and password (Add more if want)
Upon logging in:
	- User should be able to see their balance

All data relating to a user must be persisted through serialized files (File with user data)
There must be at least 2 roles: User and Admin
 	- Admins can lock/unlock a user account (When locked, a user cannot log in...i.e. can't use the application anymore)
 	- Admins must approve an account's creation before the new user can log in
 	- Admins must be able to promote users to the admin level
 	- (Have 1 admin hardcoded into a file)

 Additional Requirements

 Must log transactions with Log4J

 Note 1: Bank is an example. Can change this. (sub example: Starcraft resources)

 Note 3: Prefer to have this as a Maven project. (If not Maven, then will have to import Jars manually)

 Note 5: Try to get as much Junit 4 exposure as possible. 1 test per method
