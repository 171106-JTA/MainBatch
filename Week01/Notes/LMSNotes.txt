Topic I Got Wrong On JAVA LMS


Marker Interfaces
Interfaces in general
Try/Catch/Finally blocks 
- Are catch blocks neccessary? No!
FileReader
- reads character streams
FileInputStream 
- reads raw bytes
Default types: float b = 32.33 is invalid
Arrays 
- get size from .length
Method Overriding
- What is it?

Java Inner Classes and Nested Classes
- See: https://www.javatpoint.com/java-inner-class
==============================================
Inner Classes: 
- Inner classes have access to all data members and methods of outer class
- Why Use them? 
--- For development of readable and maintainable code
--- Code optimization...less code to write

Inner class vs Nested Class 
-> Inner class is part of nested class. 
-> Non static nested classes are inner classes

Types of Inner Classes:
Member Inner Class - a class created within class and outside method
Anonymous Inner Class 
- a class created for implementing interface or extending class. Its name is decided by the java compiler
- Created in 2 ways: Using class with overloaded methods, using an interface and defining methods. See https://www.javatpoint.com/anonymous-inner-class
(note: different than link above. example specific link)
Local Inner Class - A class created within a method

Type of Nested Classes: 
Static Nested Class - A static class created within another class
Nested Interface - An interface created within a class or interface
=============================================================================

Collection
- Iterable children of Collection
- Notation related to Collection types (List, Maps, Sets)
- various children of collection (Maps, HashTable, HashSet, Dequeu, EntrySet, etc.)

Threads 
- Creating Threads
- virtual machine states of threads
Continue statements 
- causes loops to jump to the next iteration
Java 100% OOP? No, because it has primative datatypes

String Builder and String Buffer
- Thread Safe?
