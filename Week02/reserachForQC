Virtual Method invocation
Fail Fast vs Fail Safe
Finalize

libaries used with request gc()
systym.gc
and ????

try with resources

byte code - what actually is it

Functional Interface: Declares one and only one method
- runnable
- comparable
- comparative

creating threads: Thread vs runnable

illegal monitor state method
- trying to release a lock/monitor when you don't have access to it

sleep, wait, yeild (related to threads)
Yeild: Yeilds its turn from the processor...not %100 yeild in Java (i.e. processor has precidence)

Generics: 
userd to enforce datatypes in any collections

Generic collections and classes: ???

Nested Class vs static class. like a static class but need to instantiate the outer class. Look this up

Use static block to initial static variables

When use a Singlton: a generalized functionality that doesn't change throughout execution. Something that usually takes awhile to setup

factory class; a class whose purpose is to produce other objects
- Used for loose coupling
- just call getInstance() and will always get the correct class, even when class implemented 

Java is pass by value...the references to objects are passed by value???
- what happens when pass and edit an object in a function

StringBuilder
- mutable...can be edited and appended to
- wheras Strings are not mutable (new string created when appended to)
