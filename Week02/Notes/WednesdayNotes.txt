Always write and test a select statement before running a delete statement

Be able to answer: 
What is an aggregate function?
name 3+ aggreagate functions
What is a scalar function
name 3+ aggregate functions

HAVING is also the only way to apply conditions to aggregates

=======================
JOINS
=======================
provide a means to combine two or more tables into one view
Actual Joins: (i.e. Keywords)
Inner Join
Outer Join
Cross Joins
Left Join
Right Join

Natural Join - a keyword that can be applied all the 'actual joins'
- i.e. natural right join, natural left join, etc. 

Conceptual Joins: 
Self Join
EquiJoins
Theta Joins

note: outer join == full outer join

Inner Join 
Combines tables based on column, filtering out data that does NOT appear 
in both tables
(See pg 14 of notebook for example)

Left Join
Grabs all records from the left table iand all corresponding records from the right table. If records do not exist in the right table, columns will be filled 
with NULLs
(Again, pg 14 for example)

Right Join
Same as left for right table. i.e. Grabs all records from the right table
and displays both the right table and corresponding records from the left table
if they exist. 

Full Outer
Grabs data from both tables

Cross Join
Grabs the cartesian product of 2 table. (i.e. the product of the rows...or the combination among all rows in both tables)
The result with be (Table A row_count) * (Table B row_count)

Composit Keys
- a primary key with two different columns

Normalized database
- At most 1 column shared among tables

See in class work for EQUAJOIN and THETAJOIN

=======================
Set Operations
=======================
Set operations aim to combine and filter the data between queries (note: DO NOT ever use the work 'table' when talking about Set Operations)

Unions -> return a combination of all distict records
Distict -> no dublicates

Union All -> same as union but includes duplicates

Intersect -> Filters out all records that weren't in both tables

Minus -> Removes any records from the left query that appers in the right query

NOT SUPPORTED BY ORACLE:
Except -> returns all records that are exclusive to one side

********************************************
What is the difference between Intersect and InnerJoin
InnerJoin -> the combining of two table based on a column
Intersect -> compares two queries and compares eleemnts of records
The datatypes in Intersect queries must match across columns...the column names do not need to match


what is the difference between Full Outer Join and a Union All (or Union)?

Note: you can always replicate the results using either joins or sets

Generate ERD from Oracle SQL Developer


Project 1 Part 2: 
Generate ERD through Oracle SQL Developer
Keep it "third form" or "Normalized"


Joins Vs Sets
Joins 
take 2 tables and join on a column. i.e. the tables have a column name and datatype in common. Combines all columns together
Sets
Query 2 tables and get a result set. Take those 2 result sets and combine them. 
Can only join if column count and column datatype order match.

=======================
Normalization
=======================
Normalization -> levels of structure to reduce database ambiguity and redundancy

Referential Integrity
- prevents orphan records

Atomic Data -> data at its lowerst detailed form
Candidate Key -> Any column that is used to identify others

Levels: 
ONF -> Zero Normal Form. denormalized database (e.g. data warehouse is an example of a denormalized database)
1NF -> 1st Normal Form. All data is atomic 
2NF -> There can be NO functional dependancies on partial keys
3NF -> No keys that are not identified by a candidate keys
Boyce Codd Normal Form -> No overlapping candidate keys
4NF -> Don't Care
5NF -> Dont't Care
6NF -> Don't Care
:P ONly know up to the Boyce Codd Normal Form
