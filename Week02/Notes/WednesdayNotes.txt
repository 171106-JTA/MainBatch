Always write and test a select statement before running a delete statement

Be able to answer: 
What is an aggregate function?
name 3+ aggreagate functions
What is a scalar function
name 3+ aggregate functions

HAVING is also the only way to apply conditions to aggregates

=======================
JOINS
=======================
provide a means to combine two or more tables into one view
Actual Joins: (i.e. Keywords)
Inner Join
Outer Join
Cross Joins
Left Join
Right Join

Natural Join - a keyword that can be applied all the 'actual joins'
- i.e. natural right join, natural left join, etc. 

Conceptual Joins: 
Self Join
EquiJoins
Theta Joins

note: outer join == full outer join

Inner Join 
Combines tables based on column, filtering out data that does NOT appear 
in both tables
(See pg 14 of notebook for example)

Left Join
Grabs all records from the left table iand all corresponding records from the right table. If records do not exist in the right table, columns will be filled 
with NULLs
(Again, pg 14 for example)

Right Join
Same as left for right table. i.e. Grabs all records from the right table
and displays both the right table and corresponding records from the left table
if they exist. 

Full Outer
Grabs data from both tables

Cross Join
Grabs the cartesian product of 2 table. (i.e. the product of the rows...or the combination among all rows in both tables)
The result with be (Table A row_count) * (Table B row_count)

Composit Keys
- a primary key with two different columns

Normalized database
- At most 1 column shared among tables

See in class work for EQUAJOIN and THETAJOIN

=======================
Set Operations
=======================
Set operations aim to combine and filter the data between queries (note: DO NOT ever use the work 'table' when talking about Set Operations)

Unions -> return a combination of all distict records
Distict -> no dublicates

Union All -> same as union but includes duplicates

Intersect -> Filters out all records that weren't in both tables

Minus
