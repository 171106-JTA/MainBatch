Why does interface need function signiture, when the function is implemented in the extending class? (something to do with method is used in main)

====================================
Statements
====================================
Statement
- General purpose access to the database
- Useful when using static sql statements
- Allows sql injection

Prepared Statements
- More dynamic (than statements)
- Paramterized
- Accept input at runtime
- prevents sql injection
- Precompiled by java and sql. This helps run faster and detects SQL injection
-- Checks if table exists
-- Confirms parameter types
-- Parses for correct syntax
-- Caches the query for use later

Callable Statement
- Accesses stored procedures


====================================
SQL Injection
====================================
Malicous user input that can compromise a database

Note: Good applications touch the database as few times as possible
