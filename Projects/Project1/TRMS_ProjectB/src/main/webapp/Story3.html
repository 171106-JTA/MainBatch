		<p>With the recent attacks on shipments of Ambrosia the public would believe that it would be impossible to receive treatments for the current epidemic of 
		the "Gray Death". Versalife would like to annouce that these crimes against humanity will not stop in the distribution of relief. With the completion of the 
		Ulitmate Constructor(UC) Versalife will be able to mass produce the vaccines at more than double the regular rate even the stolen shipments!</p>
		
		 <p>"We would like to reassure everyone that Versalife will always make sure that we will never abandon mankind and will not let any event come at the price of 
		 costing human lives.", said Bob Page at a recent press conference to quell concerns about the stolen shipments.</p>
