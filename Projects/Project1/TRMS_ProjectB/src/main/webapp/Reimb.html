			reimbursement maximum. This request I make will first require approval on my presentation. If I fail to present my case or receive a below passing grade (less than
			60%) then my request will be denied. I am able to attempt as many times in the year until I have until my available reimbursement has been depleted. Available 
			reimbursement will be set to $1000 upon the new year (January 1).</p>
