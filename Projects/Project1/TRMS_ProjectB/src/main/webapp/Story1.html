		<p>Due to the large number of attacks on hospitals for ambrosia from the NSF(New Sons of Freedom), Bob Page has had Versalife donate billions of dollars 
		 and sending staff to provide aide. Dr. Vinderloo from the Bolly Bolly Hospital said, "This is the greatest news we have heard in these dark times!"</p>
		 
		 <p>The NSF has been stealing all of these vaccines for their own benefit. "We thought that we would have died from the virus", said Vinderloo, "If you were ask 
		 me if I had any vaccines I could on respond: there is nothing I can do!" </p>
		
		<p>When asked why he made such a large conrtibution, Mr. Page replied, "It was simply the right thing to do." Mr.Page went on to explain that when he was driving
		through the New York Streets and saw the people suffering, he could not just stand by. "I was inspired by Thomas Aquinas, a personal hero, to strive for the 
		benefit of mankind. I believe that we will endure through these moments."</p>
