		<h1>Welcome to Versalife!</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Versalife is dedicated to creating solutions to the world's problems before they arise. Some of our research in the past has been dedicated to the augmentation
		 technologies such as neuropozyne and mechanical augmentations of the past. We are currently looking into the "Gray-Death" epidemic that has been afflicting the 
		 world. To combat this new plague Versalife is fully concentrating on Ambrosia (the vaccine for the Gray Death). Although we have the solution it does not 
		 mean that we can manufacture it so easily. Any donations will be greatly appreciated. Versalife will strive for the benefit of mankind.</p>
