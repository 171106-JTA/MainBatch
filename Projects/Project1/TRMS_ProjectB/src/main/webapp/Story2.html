		<h1>Nano-Augmentations Moving to Public Soon</h1>

		<p>It is hard to imagine that it has been 10 years since we have had Versalife introduce to the world mechanical augmentations. With the cooperation with our 
		partner Sarif Industries we were able to allow the common public to augmentations and neuropozyne. "With this technology we are able to give people there lives
		back!", said David Sarif the owner of Sarif Industries.</p>
		 
		 <p>Augementations were able to bring sight to the blind and repair or replace limbs of amputees, however this technology still had some negatives. Patients 
		 who had received the augmentations required treatment for neuropozyne. Although Versalife was able to develope new technology to remove the dependency to 
		 neuropozyne, a patient with augmentations was still stood out the public due to their mechanical appearance.</p>
		
		<p>Versalife introduced the solution to issue by now unveilling nano-augmentations. These augementations are molecular sized machines that are able to provide 
		the same functionality that mechanical augmentations can and more. They can not only replace limbs and replicated human tissue, but are also able to 
		enhance the abilities of humans. "We can now finally make advancements in treating disease and rewriting the human DNA.", explained Sarif at the National Science 
		Expo. "We can now recreate the mistakes and nature and provide every one an ideal quality of life." Bob Page concluded with saying, "I believe we are approaching 
		an age where genetic defects will be a thing of the past."</p>
