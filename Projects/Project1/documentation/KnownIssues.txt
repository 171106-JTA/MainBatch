Known issues 
============

On user registration page: 
• error tool tips don't work properly after user submits invalid form
• there are no initial managers in the system, so new users cannot set themselves under anyone
• no indication that bad form is bad; /* should have some way to report to end user that form is invalid */
	• possible fix: anyone who isn't reported to someone is a manager

On login: 
• valid login sometimes doesn't redirect the page in the browser, yet the servlet somehow receives requests from the page it was supposed to redirect to
