This is my project submission for TRMS project. The secondary "fluff" dialog may have some typos which I may fix later today(12/10/2017).
I may switch the text of the one of the buttons in the pages. Do note that while I was working with my projects I experienced a few issues with my
Eclipse IDE. So there may be some files that are still there without being called on such as the Upload servlet. To avoid removing a functionality
from the project, I felt it was better to change my orginal design to still provide the same function but with slightly different processes.
